								<p>Hi! My name is Manikanth and a business owner turned Virtual Assistant. Over the past 2 years, I had the opportunity to start three businesses from scratch and scale them. However, I didn't had much success and had to shut them down. 
                                        				For me, closing a business doesn't mean they failed. Getting out is a sign of intelligence and it doesn't reflect my qualities as a good manager - it shows I'm able to face tough situations and choose to fail rather than going down with the ship 
									into a financial chaos. Many business owners can't do this as they make decisions based on emotions but not facts. </p>
								<p>Business is not easy and needs a good team to start and scale. "I can do it all" may not work for all business types. Hustling multiple tasks can lead to burnouts and isolation. Even the best leaders need a helping hand. So, let me handle some of your 
									workload and other time-consuming assignments so that you can focus on the most important tasks to scale your business. I offer services such as general administration, business administration, project management, project coordination, data analytics, 
									social media management, market research, etc. to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). </p>
								<p>Remote work often have trust issues. It's totally fine. I always tell my clients to start slow. Once the trust is built, more workload can be shared.  With me, you don't have to worry about upfront cash deposits or credit card details. Guess what? You can start for 
									as low as US$10/hour.</p>
								<p>I'm a fluent English speaker with international study and work experience. I'm currently residing in Hyderabad, one of India's top metropolitan cities with access to high speed internet and 24/7 power supply. So, I ensure smooth workflows. 
									If you're up for a chat and want to know more about me, feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanapurmanikanth" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. </p>
