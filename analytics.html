								<h1>Project 1 (MS Excel)<br /> 
								</h1>
								<p><strong>BOOKING DATA OF HOTELS AROUND THE WORLD</strong></p>
							</header>
							<p><strong>About</strong></p>
							<p>This project utilized a real-time dataset of hotel bookings from around the world. Its primary purpose is to enable future booking predictions, assisting the hospitality industry in better preparation and customer service. However, the main objective of this project is to first understand the data, identify any unusual activities or observations, and then further explore these findings. 
								The original dataset was sourced from Kaggle (<strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand" target ="_blank">click here</a></strong>). 
							</p>
							<p><strong>Data cleaning</strong></p>
							<p>The dataset underwent a comprehensive examination to identify duplicate rows, outliers, and data types, among other factors. It was observed that the raw data was generally clean, except for the presence of duplicate rows, which were subsequently removed.</p>
							<p><strong>Data visualization</strong></p>
							<p>For all visualizations, pivot tables were employed for analysis. The primary observation within the dataset revealed that the highest number of booking cancellations occurred in Portugal compared to other countries. To investigate this finding, two hypotheses were made:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The higher rate of cancellations might be due to a larger number of online bookings. Online bookings are favored for their ease of use, flexible cancellation policies, and a wide range of room choices. This hypothesis was confirmed as a greater number of cancellations were indeed associated with online bookings. The next step involved examining the cancellation trends for the next top countries 
									following Portugal, which also contributed to a high number of booking cancellations. It was observed that in these countries as well, cancellations of online bookings dominated other modes.</li>
							</ul>		
							<p>The subsequent investigation aimed to understand why online bookings resulted in more cancellations in general. This led to an examination of cancellations by customer types, revealing that transient customers, who intend to stay for shorter duration's, had a higher rate of cancellations. Additionally, first-time booker's with respective hotels were the predominant customer group with cancellations.</p>						
							<ul>
								<li>The hypothesis that high cancellations in online bookings occurred because customers were not assigned rooms immediately after booking was not true, as most rooms were assigned on the same day.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								In summary, the dataset suggests that booking cancellations were high in Portugal due to a higher number of online bookings. However, the dataset does not provide a definitive explanation for why this leads to cancellations, as customers were typically assigned rooms immediately after booking. There is a possibility of fraudulent activities on online booking sites contributing to cancellations, but this falls outside the scope of the given dataset.

									<h1>Project 2 (SQL)<br /></h1>
									<p><strong>CUSTOMER SPENDING BEHAVIOR</strong></p>								
								</header>
								<p><strong>About</strong></p>
								<p>This project includes an exploratory analysis of customer spending behavior for a bicycle company's sales data in four countries: the USA, France, Germany, and the UK. The company sells three types of bicycle-related products: bike accessories, bicycles, and bike clothing. 
									The primary objective of this project is to comprehend customer's purchasing and spending behavior based on the price of the products offered by the company. The original dataset was sourced from Kaggle (<strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-customer-spending-habits-to-improve-sa" target ="_blank">click here</a></strong>).</p>
								<p><strong>Data cleaning</strong></p>
								<p>Please refer to the PDF document below for the steps taken to clean the original data. Some of the attributes in the original dataset were unnecessary for the analysis. Therefore, a new table was created, including only the essential information. The raw dataset was mostly clean, except for the Null values in the country column, which were removed during the cleaning phase.</p>
								<div class="pdf-container"><iframe src="pdfs/Customer_Spending_Cleaning.pdf" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="500"></iframe></div>
								<p><strong>Queries</strong></p>
								<p>To address business questions related to customer spending behavior, sales trends, product revenue, etc., SQL queries were composed in BigQuery. As there were multiple questions to address, queries related to them were consolidated into a single script using temporary tables. This approach simplifies the process of saving queries related to individual questions as CSV files for visualization purposes.
									Please refer to the PDF document below for a detailed account of the steps taken.
								</p>
							    <div class="pdf-container"><iframe src="pdfs/Customer_Spending_Queries.pdf" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="500"></iframe></div>
								<p><strong>Data visualization</strong></p>
								<p>All the CSV files generated from the queries were initially uploaded to a single Excel document in xlsx format. This was done to save time on uploading individual files and to facilitate the establishment of relationships between individual sheets for subsequent filtering in Tableau Public for visualization purposes. Some key conclusions drawn from this dataset are as follows: </p>
							    <ul>
									<li> Females did not seem to be influenced by the price point and spent more, purchasing a higher number of bicycles and bike accessories compared to men. Similarly, within the age group of adults, between the ages of 30 and 45, there was a higher level of spending, and this demographic contributed the most revenue, purchasing more units across all product categories.</li>
									<li>The overall purchasing behavior of customers, regardless of age and gender, leaned towards purchasing more units of bike accessories due to their lower price point compared to other categories.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>For an overview of the parameters considered in the analysis, please refer to the attached Customer Spending Behavior Dashboard below.

				<h1>Project 3 (Tableau)<br />
				</h1>
				<p><strong>BIRD STRIKES IN THE USA (2000-11)</strong></p>
			</header>
			<p><strong>About</strong></p>
			<p>This project contains bird Strikes data of the USA between 2000 and 2011. The dataset includes various parameters such as altitude, sky conditions, number of people injured, origin state of the flight, flight type, etc. 
				The original dataset was obtained from data.world </p>
			<p><strong>Data cleaning</strong></p>
			<p>The dataset was already clean and ready to be visualized to gain important insights using Tableau Public.</p>
			<p><strong>Data visualization</strong></p>
			<p>The first step was to investigate the trend of bird strikes over time. It was observed that the average bird strikes followed an incremental trend. This was an interesting observation. To explore this further, a hypothesis was made:</p>
			<p>Bird strikes increased over time, possibly due to a lack of warning given to the pilots. However, this was not the case, as it didn't make any difference; even after improvements in warnings over the years, bird strikes continued to rise. One important observation made was that early warnings reduced injuries to passengers on board.</p>
			<p>It was identified that coastal areas experienced higher bird strike rates, and most of the incidents occurred at altitudes below 10,000 feet in cloudy conditions.</p>
			<p>*Please refer to the attached bird strikes dashboard below for an overview of the parameters considered in the analysis.</p>
