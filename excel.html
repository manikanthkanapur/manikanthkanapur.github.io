								<p><strong>CLEANING OF YOUTUBE SCRAPPED DATA</strong></p>
							</header>
							<p><strong>About</strong></p>
							<p>This project contains YouTube scrapped data which was collected using web scrapping techniques. 
								A scrapped data is a data which is collected automatically by web scrapping tools from the internet. It is generally a dirty data which is good to practice excel skills. 
								The original dataset was sourced from Kaggle (<strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gaurav2022/youtube-scrapped-data?resource=download" target ="_blank">click here</a></strong>).

							<ul>
								<li>I removed duplicate rows from the dataset using the "Remove Duplicates" tool.</li>
								<li>I reorganized the dataset.</li>
								<li>I converted titles to text format. According to YouTube guidelines as of 2021, the maximum allowable title length is 100 characters. Therefore, any titles exceeding this limit were deleted, along with any blank titles. To accomplish this, I used the "Filters" tool.</li>
								<li> I removed comments and text from the "Upload Date" column. Next, I used functions such as "IF," "LEFT," and "RIGHT" to separate the Upload Dates from Streamline and Premier dates. Since all the dates were in text format, I converted them to date format. However, the Streamline and 
									Premier dates remained in text format even after conversion, so I used the "DATEVALUE" function to convert them to date format.</li>
								<li>In the "Views" column, I removed the term "views" from the end of each cell and retained only the numbers. To achieve this, I used the "FIND" tool. Then, I converted the column range to number format.</li>
								<li>Some of the entries in the "Likes" column had a "k" at the end. To convert these likes to thousands, I used a combination of "IF," "RIGHT," "VALUE," and "LEN" functions.</li>
								<li>I converted Timestamps into separate columns for date and time using the "INT" and "MOD" functions.</li>
								<li>Comments made by different individuals were separated by "||". To split individual comments into distinct columns, I used the "TEXTSPLIT" function. Finally, I selected only three comments and deleted the rest.</li>

								<h1>Project 2<br /> 
								</h1>
								<p><strong>BOOKING DATA OF HOTELS AROUND THE WORLD</strong></p>
							</header>
							<p><strong>About</strong></p>
							<p>This project utilized a real-time dataset of hotel bookings from around the world. Its primary purpose is to enable future booking predictions, assisting the hospitality industry in better preparation and customer service. However, the main objective of this project is to first understand the data, identify any unusual activities or observations, and then further explore these findings. 
								The original dataset was sourced from Kaggle (<strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand" target ="_blank">click here</a></strong>). 
							</p>
							<p><strong>Data cleaning</strong></p>
							<p>The dataset underwent a comprehensive examination to identify duplicate rows, outliers, and data types, among other factors. It was observed that the raw data was generally clean, except for the presence of duplicate rows, which were subsequently removed.</p>
							<p><strong>Data visualization</strong></p>
							<p>For all visualizations, pivot tables were employed for analysis. The primary observation within the dataset revealed that the highest number of booking cancellations occurred in Portugal compared to other countries. To investigate this finding, two hypotheses were made:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The higher rate of cancellations might be due to a larger number of online bookings. Online bookings are favored for their ease of use, flexible cancellation policies, and a wide range of room choices. This hypothesis was confirmed as a greater number of cancellations were indeed associated with online bookings. The next step involved examining the cancellation trends for the next top countries 
									following Portugal, which also contributed to a high number of booking cancellations. It was observed that in these countries as well, cancellations of online bookings dominated other modes.</li>
							</ul>		
							<p>The subsequent investigation aimed to understand why online bookings resulted in more cancellations in general. This led to an examination of cancellations by customer types, revealing that transient customers, who intend to stay for shorter duration's, had a higher rate of cancellations. Additionally, first-time booker's with respective hotels were the predominant customer group with cancellations.</p>						
							<ul>
								<li>The hypothesis that high cancellations in online bookings occurred because customers were not assigned rooms immediately after booking was not true, as most rooms were assigned on the same day.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								In summary, the dataset suggests that booking cancellations were high in Portugal due to a higher number of online bookings. However, the dataset does not provide a definitive explanation for why this leads to cancellations, as customers were typically assigned rooms immediately after booking. There is a possibility of fraudulent activities on online booking sites contributing to cancellations, but this falls outside the scope of the given dataset.

								<h1>Project 3<br /> 
								</h1>
								<p><strong>SALES DATA OF A SUPERMARKET CHAIN IN MYANMAR</strong></p>
							</header>
							<p><strong>About</strong></p>
							<p>This project contains sales data for a chain of three stores in Myanmar spanning three months, from January to March 2019. The original dataset was taken from Kaggle (<strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales" target ="_blank">click here</a></strong>). 
							</p>
							<p><strong>Data cleaning</strong></p>
							<p>The dataset underwent a thorough examination to identify duplicate rows, outliers, and data types. It was observed that the raw data was generally clean, except for date data types. All the dates were in text format, and they were subsequently converted to date format.</p>
							<p><strong>Data visualization</strong></p>
							<p>For all the visualizations, pivot tables were employed for the analysis. The primary observation within the dataset was that the overall sales for February, across all branches, were slightly lower than in other months. To investigate this finding, monthly trends for all branches were examined, but no significant insights were uncovered. As a result, a hypothesis was considered:</p>
							<p>The average ratings of the previous month, i.e., January, affected the sales in February.</p>
							<p>Observation: The average rating for January was approximately 7 on a scale of 10, which is considered satisfactory. The average rating for February was also around 7. The difference between the two ratings is not substantial. If there had been a significant improvement in the ratings for February, this hypothesis might have held true. However, other potential factors that could have 
								influenced sales in February were explored, but these efforts did not yield positive results. Therefore, the final conclusion is that the dataset is a general dataset, and can be used to understand the data with the help of visualizations.</p>
							<p>Additionally, some other interesting findings were made, the most noteworthy being:
							<ul>
								<li>Females spent more on food & beverages, whereas men spent more on health & beauty products.</li>
								<li>Females with membership cards contributed more to sales, while men did not show as much interest in having a membership.</li>
							</ul
